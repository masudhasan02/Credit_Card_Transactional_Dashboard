# Credit_Card_Transactional_Dashboard
This project aims to develop a comprehensive credit card weekly dashboard using Power BI to provide real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends. The dashboard enables stakeholders to monitor and analyze credit card operations effectively, helping them make data-driven decisions. The data is sourced from a PostgreSQL server, which is connected to Power BI for visualization and analysis.

The dashboard provides a detailed overview of weekly and year-to-date (YTD) performance metrics, including revenue, transaction amounts, customer counts, and delinquency rates. It also breaks down data by various categories such as card type, customer demographics, expenditure types, and geographic regions.

# Credit_Card_Customer_Report

This project focuses on building an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze customer behavior and performance trends related to credit card usage. The dashboard provides real-time insights into key customer metrics, helping stakeholders understand revenue contributions, satisfaction levels, and customer profiles across various dimensions. The dataset is sourced from a PostgreSQL server, integrated with Power BI for visualization and advanced analytics.

The dashboard offers an in-depth view of customer-centric performance indicators such as revenue, income, total interest earned, and satisfaction scores. It also highlights patterns based on demographics and financial behavior, including age group, marital status, income level, education, and state-wise revenue distribution. Additionally, it explores correlations between personal loan status, car ownership, and spending habits to support data-driven customer engagement strategies.
