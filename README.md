# Credit_Card_Transactional_Dashboard
This project aims to develop a comprehensive credit card weekly dashboard using Power BI to provide real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends. The dashboard enables stakeholders to monitor and analyze credit card operations effectively, helping them make data-driven decisions. The data is sourced from a PostgreSQL server, which is connected to Power BI for visualization and analysis.

The dashboard provides a detailed overview of weekly and year-to-date (YTD) performance metrics, including revenue, transaction amounts, customer counts, and delinquency rates. It also breaks down data by various categories such as card type, customer demographics, expenditure types, and geographic regions.
